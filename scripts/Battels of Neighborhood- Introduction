1.	Introduction

Mumbai is the financial capital and most densely populated city of India. After living a few years in Mumbai, I am keen on bringing a problem around the neighborhood of Mumbai.
While Mumbai people spend most of their leisure time at malls or theaters, I am bringing out the new potential areas where a real estate company can build new shopping 
malls/theaters.

To find the best potential location for constructing a shopping mall/theater, I considered two main parameters – 1) total number of current shopping malls/theaters in each area
and 2) population density for each neighborhood in Mumbai.

An investor would be interested in knowing the statistics of each area in Mumbai through a map where he/she can analyze the Mumbai neighborhood to find 
the potential areas for building new shopping malls/theaters. 
 
2.	Data Description

I gathered and prepared the following data using python libraries and APIs as below:
 
•	Extracted the Mumbai Neighborhood details from Wikipedia and were able to get Latitude and Longitude for each area
•	Extracted venue details using Foursquare API to find shopping malls/theaters in the neighborhood area
•	Analyzed the neighborhood using K-Means clustering machine learning algorithm and used Silhouette Score to find out the best K for K-Means and used Folium map to visualize 
clusters into the map
•	Extracted Mumbai GeoJosn data from a GitHub library 
•	Found Mumbai area wise population density details online and used Choropleth map to populate population density for each location
